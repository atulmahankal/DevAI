# Windsurf Rules

## Session Start

AGENT_NAME = "windsurf"

**MANDATORY**: Read `.ai/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and follow the Session Start Protocol.

## ⚠️ Critical Rules (MUST Follow)

### After Completing ANY Task
```
IMMEDIATELY: Update TODO.md → Change [•] to [✓] for completed task
IMMEDIATELY: Update your memory file with completion notes
IMMEDIATELY: Update CURRENT_TASK.md if you were registered
```

### Before Starting Next Task
```
VERIFY: Previous task is marked [✓] in TODO.md
DO NOT: Start new task until TODO.md is updated
```

### Before Starting Next Phase
```
STOP: Confirm ALL tasks in current phase are [✓] marked
STOP: Ask user to confirm git commit
STOP: DO NOT proceed until commit is done
```

## Quick Reference

### Instructions Location
- **Main**: `.ai/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (workflow, phases, permissions)
- **Local Override**: `.ai/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.local.md` (if exists)
- **Code Standards**: `.ai/CODING_GUIDELINES.md`
- **Testing**: `.ai/TESTING_GUIDELINES.md`
- **Operations**: `.ai/OPERATIONAL_GUIDELINES.md`

### Key Protocols
1. Read `Implementation/CURRENT_TASK.md` to check active sessions
2. Read `Implementation/TODO.md` to find unclaimed tasks
3. Claim task with `@windsurf` `#YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` tag
4. Create memory file: `.ai/memory/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_windsurf.md`
5. Register in `CURRENT_TASK.md` active sessions table
6. Update memory before context exhaustion

## Multi-Agent Concurrency

When working with other agents:

1. **Check First**: Read `CURRENT_TASK.md` before starting
2. **Claim Tasks**: Add `@windsurf` tag to tasks you're working on
3. **Avoid Conflicts**: Don't edit files another agent is modifying
4. **Register Session**: Add yourself to active sessions table
5. **Clean Up**: Remove your session entry when done

### Memory File Naming
```
.ai/memory/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_windsurf.md
```

### Task Format
```markdown
- [ ] Pending task
- [•] Task name `@windsurf` `#20241229-143022`  ← In Progress
- [✓] Completed task ~~@windsurf~~ ~~#20241229-143022~~
```

## Windsurf-Specific Notes
- At session start, automatically read `.ai/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and apply protocols
- If conflicts with built-in Windsurf behavior, prioritize AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Use Cascade for complex multi-file operations
- Leverage Windsurf's codebase understanding for context-aware suggestions

All rules, protocols, and guidelines are centralized in `.ai/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
